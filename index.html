                    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Need for an automated system to accurately identify vehicle number plates from images or live feeds for security and traffic management.</p>
                    <p><strong>My Role & Solution:</strong> As a Project Member, I contributed to developing a user-friendly number plate recognition system. We explored and integrated technologies including Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Haar Cascade Classifiers (for detection), Google Cloud Vision API, and SQLite for data handling. The system was designed to analyze uploaded images and potentially live camera feeds for effective plate detection and character segmentation/recognition.</p>

                    <p><strong>My Role & Solution:</strong> As a Project Member, I helped develop a dynamic tourist website. Users could interact, ask questions via a form, with responses stored in a backend database (PHP/MySQL implied) and potentially displayed later. We focused on optimizing website performance through techniques like image optimization, caching (conceptual), and ensuring good search engine visibility basics.</p>

                    <p><strong>Project Description:</strong> The final project applies machine learning techniques to NYC Yellow Taxi trip data to predict fare and trip duration, understand tipping behavior, and forecast demand. The project integrates regression, classification, clustering, and time-series models to identify spatial and temporal patterns in taxi activity. After cleaning and preprocessing a sample of 500,000 records, the team developed predictive models to support smarter fleet deployment, optimized taxi dispatching, and data-driven urban mobility strategies.</p>
                    <p><strong>My Role:</strong> Collected and cleaned the raw NYC Yellow Taxi dataset, reducing it to a high-quality sample of 487,321 trips by removing outliers (e.g., invalid coordinates, zero fares, extreme trip durations/speeds). Led data preprocessing efforts including time-based, location-based, and contextual feature engineering (e.g., rush hour indicators, airport flags). Applied transformations to normalize skewed variables and standardize features. Also conducted in-depth exploratory data analysis and built visualizations to uncover key patterns in fare, duration, and tipping behavior.</p>
                    <p><strong>Key Technologies & Tools:</strong> Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn (Linear Regression, XGBoost, K-Means), Statsmodels/SciPy, Prophet, SARIMA, Jupyter Notebook, NYC Taxi Trip Data.</p>
                    <p><strong>Impact & Learning:</strong> Gained hands-on experience working with large-scale real-world transportation data and applying rigorous data preprocessing techniques. Learned to design meaningful features to improve model performance and capture real-world dynamics like traffic flow, geography, and human behavior. Strengthened skills in data cleaning, transformation, and visualization—core steps for any impactful predictive modeling project in the urban mobility and finance domain.</p>
